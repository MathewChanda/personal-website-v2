title: Initial Commit 
---

Hey, thanks for visiting my blog. 

I'm Rohan, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

This blog post is more or less an initial commit; minimum workings for a viable product. I hope to add more meaningful
projects in the coming months.

In the meantime, I encourage you to take a look around this page, and feel free to [reach out to me](/contact){:target="_blank"}. Thanks!
