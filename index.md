##  My Elevator Pitch
I study Computer Engineering at [The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://ece.illinois.edu/){:target="_blank"}. Ever since I was in middle school, I've been building robots and writing software to interface with them. I'm particularly passionate about autonomous systems, whether that be enabling robots to percieve and react without needing teleoperability, or being able to manage personal assets and finances with one click. Every script, line of code and failing CI/CD pipeline I write contributes to my hopefully not-so pipe dream of having my own version of [Tony Stark's Basement](./assets/ironman.jpg){:target="_blank"}.

##  What I'm up to


Previously, I was at
<a href="https://www.nvidia.com" class = 'nvidia'>NVIDIA</a> working on GPU architecture (primarily NVLINK).

I'll be working on Core Services at
<a href="https://www.squarespace.com" class = 'squarespace'>Squarespace</a> this summer, and will be in Chicago at <a href="https://www.citadel.com" class = 'citadel'>Citadel</a> in the fall.

During the school year, I'm an Undergraduate Researcher at the [Intelligent Motion Laboratory](https://motion.cs.illinois.edu){:target="_blank"}, where I write software to enable autonomous actions and decisions for our nursing robot. We're competing in an XPRIZE competition through 2022; you can read more about it [here](https://avatar.xprize.org/prizes/avatar){:target="_blank"}! 



## What's next for me?

Great question. Usually, I couldn't tell you, but here's a list of things I'm aiming to achieve before 2022:

* Build an Operating System from scratch ✔️ 
* Write a unification-based type inferencer ✔️ 
* Learn to dunk on a 10ft rim

Last Year's List: 
* Do better than average in [ECE 210](./assets/hahaece210funny.png){:target="_blank"} ✔️ (well, I passed, so it's a W in my book)
* Build an LED music visualizer to integrate with my [Spotify Jukebox](https://github.com/rohanp9000/spotify-queue-client){:target="_blank"} ❌ (because I didn't go back to campus - stay tuned)
* Write and implement a computer vision pipeline for [TRINA](https://avatarxprize.web.illinois.edu/wp/){:target="_blank"} ✔️ 
* Write a technical blog post for a personal project ❌  (spent all my time on leetcode)
