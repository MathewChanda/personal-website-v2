##  My Elevator Pitch

I study Computer Engineering at [The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://ece.illinois.edu/){:target="_blank"}. Ever since I was in middle school, I've been building robots and writing software to interface with them. I'm particularly passionate about autonomous systems, whether that be enabling robots to percieve and react without needing teleoperability, or being able to manage personal assets and finances with one click. Every script, line of code and failing CI/CD pipeline I write contributes to my hopefully not-so pipe dream of having my own version of [Tony Stark's Basement](./assets/ironman.jpg){:target="_blank"}.

##  What I'm up to

This summer I'll be a Software Engineering Intern at Capital One in New York City through the Technology Internship Program. I'm still looking for spring internship opportunities, so don't hesitate to reach out [here](/contact)!

During the school year, I'm an Undergraduate Researcher at the [Intelligent Motion Laboratory](https://motion.cs.illinois.edu){:target="_blank"}, where I write software to enable autonomous actions and decisions for our nursing robot. We're competing in an XPRIZE competition through 2022; you can read more about it [here](https://avatar.xprize.org/prizes/avatar){:target="_blank"}! 



## What's next for me?

Great question. Usually, I couldn't tell you, but here's a list of things I'm aiming to achieve before 2021:
* Do better than average in [ECE 210](./assets/hahaece210funny.png){:target="_blank"}
* Recruit for a spring software internship
* Build an LED music visualizer to integrate with my [Spotify Jukebox](https://github.com/rohanp9000/spotify-queue-client){:target="_blank"}
* Write and implement a computer vision pipeline for [TRINA](https://avatarxprize.web.illinois.edu/wp/){:target="_blank"}
* Write a technical blog post for a personal project
