## Personal Website

This is the first iteration of my personal website, built in August of 2020. It serves as a personal portfolio of myself. 

### Color Palette

I mostly mimiced my school's color pallete (The University of Illinois). You can find the two shades below:

![#E84A27](https://via.placeholder.com/10/E84A27?text=+) `#E84A27`</br> (Alma Orange)
![#0455A4](https://via.placeholder.com/10/0455A4?text=+) `#0455A4`</br> (Illinois Blue)


### Resources Used

I used the following, but not limited to, resources

- Ruby
- Jekyll
- Javascript
- CSS Webkit
- ImgIcon

### Final Product

My website is by no means complete. I hope to add to it as I explore new frameworks, and hopefully populate the 'blog' portion with some meaningful writing by the end of 2021. You can check it out at [rohanprasad.me](http://rohanprasad.me).
