### You're probably wondering how I got here

Sometimes, I do too. In middle/high-school I was an avid [FIRST](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc){:target="_blank"}-er. For four years, I wrote software, designed sensor boards, competed among the best high schools in America, and co-captained [team 5422](http://www.stormgears.org/){:target="_blank"} along the way. Four world-championship runs later, I'm married to the idea of making robots work for me (well, in a more figurative sense).

Fast forward a year, and I've wrapped up my internship and passing time before the semester starts and I can finally take classes again...**remotely?**

So, I created this; to both document myself, and some projects that I'll be working on in the next few months while COVID is still rampant. I hope to document them more thoroughly in the coming months, but for now, they're as below:

* [3-D 6-DOF grasp generation](./assets/397report.pdf){:target="_blank"}
* [Universal Spotify Jukebox](https://github.com/rohanp9000/spotify-queue-client){:target="_blank"}
* [MODIS Cloud Segmentation](https://github.com/rohanp9000/modis-cloud-detection){:target="_blank"}
* [This Website](/){:target="_blank"}
