### You're probably wondering how I got here

Sometimes, I am too. In middle/high-school I was an avid [FIRST](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc){:target="_blank"}-er. For four years, I wrote software, designed sensor boards, competed among the best high schools in America, and co-captained [team 5422](http://www.stormgears.org/){:target="_blank"} along the way. Four world-championship runs later, I'm married to the idea of making robots work for me (well, in a more figurative sense).

Fast forward a year, and I've wrapped up my internship and passing time before the semester starts and I can finally take classes again...**remotely?**

So, I created this; to both document myself, and some projects that I'll be working on in the next few months while COVID is still rampant.

If you'd like to keep up with some projects that I've been working on, you can find them [here](/projects), or among the tabs up top.
